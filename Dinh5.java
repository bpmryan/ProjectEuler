    // Initial Idea:
    // Create 2 loops similar to Dinh4
    // One to generate a number to be divided by
    // Another dividing the number from 1-20
    // Method to check if the number is less than the last
    // Save the smaller number

    // Quicker idea:
    // Apply the prime factorization method
    // Use all primes from 1-20
    // Find highest power of each prime <= 20
    // Multiply them
